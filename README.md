# PT.PM (PT Pattern Matching Engine)

**PT Pattern Matching Engine**, or **PT.PM,** is an engine for searching patterns in the source code.
PT.PM is based on Unified Abstract Syntax Tree ([UAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree#Unified_AST),
UST). At present time C\#, Java, PHP, PL/SQL, T-SQL, and JavaScript
are supported. Patterns can be described within the code or using a
domain-specific language (DSL).

## Use Cases and API (TODO)

## Console API (TODO)

## DSL Description and Examples of Patterns (TODO)

## Projects Description

* Creating an AST from the source code and converting this parse tree to UST 
(C\#, Java, PHP, PL/SQL, T-SQL, and JavaScript are implemented).
* PT.PM.CSharpAstConversion for C\#- and ASP.NET files (.aspx, .ascx, etc.).
	* PT.PM.JavaAstConversion
	* PT.PM.PhpAstConversion
	* PT.PM.SqlAstConversion (for PL/SQL Ð¸ T-SQL)
	* PT.PM.JavaScriptAstConversion
* DSL processing:
	* PT.PM.Patterns
	* PT.PM.Dsl
* UST preprocessing:
	* PT.PM.UstPreprocessing
* Patterns and UST matching:
	* PT.PM.Patterns
	* PT.PM.Matching

Further projects:

* PT.PM.Common is an helper shared library.
* PT.PM.AntlrUtils are the helper methods for working with ANTLR
    grammars.
* PT.PM is a common workflow (combining work steps, their timing).
* PT.PM.Console is used for interaction with a console. Also it contains
   an implementation of loggers.
* PT.PM.Prebuild is a utility for creating parsers from ANTLR grammars
    that takes into consideration the changes in the grammars files.
* PT.PM.PatternEditor is an editor for creating and checking the user
    patterns. This GUI can be used to check the correctness of grammars
    and parsing algorithms, convert and match an UST.
